# Liri-node-app

# Project Idea
The use of this project is used to do a query to 3 different API's (My Band API, Spotifty, OMDB) giving you different information based on the selector. This is useful for finding three different forms of entertainment (Concerts, Music, Movies respectively). All command/search history is stored in the random.txt file. This application was created entirely for work, and is no longer being updated for bugs/issues.

## Selectors
#### Concert-this
- This is used to find the newest concert of the band selected. It will send back the information of the location and venue of the bands most upcoming concert

- This command is used to find the songs artist, album it is on, as well as a link to the song.

### Movie-This
- This command is used to find the information of a movie in the search and send back to the results of:  
  -Title of the movie.  
  -Year the movie came out  
  -IMBD Rating of the movie  
  -Rotten tomatoes rating of the movie.  
  -Country where the movie was produced.  
  -Language of the movie.  
  -Short plot of the movie.  
  -Actors in the movie.

### Do-what-it-says
-This command is used to search up the first save stored on the random.txt file, which in this case is searching Backstreet boys I want it that way.
